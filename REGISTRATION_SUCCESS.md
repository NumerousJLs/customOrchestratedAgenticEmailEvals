## 🔧 Keep It Running:

### Current Processes:
```bash
# Agent process
PID: 23698
Command: python agents/layer1_context/context_analyzer_chat.py

# Tunnel process
PID: 24681
Command: cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8101
```

### If You Need to Restart:

**Terminal 1 - Agent:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/layer1_context/context_analyzer_chat.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Tunnel:**
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8101
# Note: This will generate a NEW URL!
# You'll need to re-register with the new URL
```

### Check Status:
```bash
# Check if agent is responding
curl http://localhost:8101/status

# Check if tunnel is working
curl https://lung-acid-motorola-buck.trycloudflare.com/status

# See running processes
ps aux | grep -E "context_analyzer|cloudflared" | grep -v grep
```

## 📋 Next Steps:

### 1. Get Your Agent Address ⭐
Visit https://agentverse.ai/ and find your agent address (agent1q...)

### 2. Test on Agentverse
Use the Agentverse chat interface to test your agent

### 3. Deploy More Agents
Repeat this process for the other 11 agents:
- Each needs its own port (8102, 8103, etc.)
- Each needs its own tunnel
- Each gets registered separately

### 4. Update Your Orchestrator
Once you have all agent addresses:
```python
orchestrator = AgentverseOrchestrator({
    "context_analyzer": "agent1q...",
    "relationship_mapper": "agent1q...",
    # ... etc
})
```

### 5. For Production
- Consider Cloudflare named tunnels (require account)
- Or deploy as hosted agents on Agentverse
- Free tunnels have no uptime guarantee

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Tunnel URL
- **Temporary:** Changes every restart
- **No SLA:** Free tier, no guarantee
- **For testing:** Not for production

### API Key Warning
You're using a placeholder API key. While registration worked, you may want to:
1. Get a real Agentverse API key from https://agentverse.ai/
2. Update `.env` with `AGENTVERSE_API_KEY=your_real_key`
3. This enables full agent details upload

### Seed Phrase
**KEEP SECURE:** Your seed phrase is like a private key:
```
AGENT_SEED_PHRASE=X283S43BCK+VMylTAUp/Cx4qXnR3/PQOfDQsYxbvuOk=
```
- Same seed = same agent address
- Different seed = different agent
- Don't share publicly!
